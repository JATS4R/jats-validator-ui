`jats-validator-ui` provides a user interface for choosing a JATS XML file to be validated with the JATS4R [`jats-validator`](https://github.com/JATS4R/jats-validator) web service, and for viewing the validation results alongside the input XML.

The app is built for static deployment with `npm run build` and can be run locally for development with `npm run start`.
